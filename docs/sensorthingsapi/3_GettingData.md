# Getting Data

The OGC SensorThings API is a RESTful API, this means that data from the API can be easily viewed using a normal Web Browser.
One can simply navigate from one object to the next by clicking the URLs provided within the data.

For more information, please see the following sections:
* [Data Model](requestingData/STA-Data-Model.html)
* [Basic Requests](requestingData/STA-Basic-Requests.html)
* [Tailoring Responses](requestingData/STA-Tailoring-Responses.html)
* [Filtering Entities](requestingData/STA-Filtering.html)
* [Expading Entities](requestingData/STA-Expading.html)
* [Example Queries](requestingData/STA-Example-Queries.html)


If you're more for a hands-on approach, you can also just start playing with some of our services. Here's the link for near-real-time air quality data:
