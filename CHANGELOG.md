## Release version 2.0.0

Version 2.0 contains many large updates to the FROST-Server codebase, greatly increasing its flexibility.
Much functionality is now controlled by plugins, from the data model to result formats.


**Upgrading from 1.x**

First update to 1.14.x or 1.15.x and run the Update Database script to ensure the database schema is fully up to date.
After this version 2.x can be used on the same Database.

FROST 2.x is more strict when it comes to relation names when filtering. Frost 1.x would accept
 `/ObservedProperties?$filter=Datastream/name` even though an ObservedProperty has a `Datastreams`
 (plural) relation and not a `Datastream` (singular) relation. Version 2.x will give an error in this case.

FROST 2.x does not allow `$resultMetadata` in `$expand`.

**New Features**
* The data model provided by FROST-Server is now completely defined in plugins.
  This means it is possible to use FROST-Server with a totally different data
  model, or to create plugins that extend the existing core SensorThings API
  data model.
* API endpoints are defined by plugins.
* New plugin: _CoreModel_ supplies the core data model from the _OGC SensorThings
  API Part 1: Sensing_ version 1.0 and 1.1 and supplies the `/v1.0` and `/v1.1`
  end points.
* New plugin: _MultiDatastream_ supplies the MultiDatastream extension.
* New plugin: _Actuation_ supplies the Actuation data model from the
  _OGC SensorThings API Part 2 â€“ Tasking Core_.
* New experimental plugin: _OData_ adds the OData 4.0 compatible end point `/ODATA_4.0` and
  the OData 4.01 end point `/ODATA_4.01`.
* PersistenceManagers are no longer tied to the ID type. There is now only one
  `persistenceManagerImplementationClass`, used for all ID types. The ID type is
  now set in the data model plugin.
* Types of primary keys can be set on a per-table basis.
* Data is directly streamed from the database to the http response instead of
  to a full intermediate model and String, greatly improving memory use.
* The option alwaysOrderById now works directly on the query instead of the
  persistenceManager and is enabled by default.
* Faster Paging: instead of always using $skip, FROST-Server now generates a filter
  to improve paging speed if it is possible to do so. The query must have an (automatic)
  orderby on the primary key.
* Faster Counting: There are four options for faster, though less accurate, ways
  to count entities. Using either [TABLESAMPLE (1)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html) or 
  [EXPLAIN](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Count_estimate) in combination with
  a limit on the SQL Count.
* Generated Features Of Interest now use the name, description and properties of
  the Location they are generated from.


## Release Version 1.14.0

**New Features**
* Added support for Batch Requests in JSON format instead of MultiPart
  format. This makes Batch Requests much easier to create. (Thanks pbaumard)

**Internal changes & Bugfixes**
* Increased the performance of the Datastream-update triggers that run on Observation
  insert/update/delete by up to 20%.
* Fixed deep-select not working for GeoJSON and CSV ResultFormats.
* Fixed newest mosquitto not working in docker-compose demo.
* Fix CME when getting parallel requests directly after startup.
* Regularly check if connection with message bus is there, connect if not
* Fixed the search_path if Liquibase changes it.
* Fixed double URLEncode in $select of nextLinks.
* Fixed Content-ID referencing in batch requests.
* Fixed batch request with encoded characters in the URL or relative resource paths.
* Fixed newlines in batch-request response.


## Release Version 1.13.0

**New Features**
* Added HTTP tool to index page, for simple POST/PATCH/DELETE commands.
* Implemented deep & distinct select. It is now possible to $select into properties
  and other JSON fields, to only get parts of the properties, and to get all the
  distinct values of properties.
  https://fraunhoferiosb.github.io/FROST-Server/extensions/DeepSelect.html
  https://fraunhoferiosb.github.io/FROST-Server/extensions/SelectDistinct.html

**Internal changes & Bugfixes**

* Fixed conformance class URLs.
* Reduced logging output and how long logfiles are kept
* [HELM]: Fixed Ingress rewrite rules to work with nginx ingress version 0.22.0 and above.


## Release Version 1.12.0

**Caution**: The default values for the HELM-Chart have been changed.
This changes the default behaviour if values are not overwritten.
Keep this in mind when updating an existing instance.
It mainly affects installations without an enabled ingress resource.
* `frost.http.ingress.enabled` is now enabled by default
* `frost.mqtt.ports.mqtt.nodePort` doesn't contain a default value, so Kubernetes will choose a free port
* `frost.mqtt.ports.websocket.nodePort` doesn't contain a default value, so Kubernetes will choose a free port
* Database is changed from `mdillon/postgis:latest` to `postgis/postgis:11-2.5-alpine`.

**New Features**
* Added a resultFormat=GeoJSON, as described in: [GeoJSON-ResultFormat.md](https://fraunhoferiosb.github.io/FROST-Server/extensions/GeoJSON-ResultFormat.md).
* Added a custom entity linking extension, as described in: [EntityLinking.md](https://github.com/INSIDE-information-systems/SensorThingsAPI/blob/master/EntityLinking/Linking.md).
* The safe_cast_to_ functions in PostgreSQL are now IMMUTABLE so they can be used in indices.
* Converted JSON-holding columns to JsonB.
  **Caution**: On large databases this conversion can take considerable time, during
  which the table being converted is locked.

**Internal changes & Bugfixes**
* The JSON writer component is now about 5 times as fast.
* Fixed PostgreSQL triggers not running for MultiDatastreams.


## Release Version 1.11.0

**New Features**
* Initial support for SensorThings API version 1.1 was added. This is still subject
  to change, since version 1.1 is not officially released yet.
* ResultFormatters can now be supplied as plugins.
* Added a resultFormat=CSV, as described in: [CSV-ResultFormat](https://github.com/INSIDE-information-systems/SensorThingsAPI/blob/master/CSV-ResultFormat/CSV-ResultFormat.md).
* Added a plugin that generates an OpenAPI description in v1.x/api, disabled by default.

**Internal changes & Bugfixes**
* Fixed #132: HistoricalLocations not notified for auto-generated HLs.
* Fixed creating Tasks via MQTT not working.
* Fixed #125: TaskingCapabilities not created when posting a Thing.
* Refactored the data + path models and generic utils into separate packages.
* Adding support for creating Tasks via MQTT.
* Fixed TaskingCapabilities not created when posting a Thing.
* Fixed (Multi)Datastream times not being corrected correctly.
* Removed QueryDSL based persistence manager implementations.


## Release Version 1.10

**New Features**
* Actuation support. By default the actuation entities are hidden from the index,
  and from navigationLinks. By turning on the setting `enableActuation` the entities
  and navigationLinks are shown. Validation of the taskingParameters is not
  implemented yet.
* MultiDatastreams can be hidden from the index page and from navigationLinks by
  setting enableMultiDatastream to false. By default MultiDatastreams are enabled.
* Added experimental support for a serverSettings element to the index page, as
  discussed on the SensorThings API GitHub page: <https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings/issues/4>.
* Added database persistence manager implementations using JOOQ instead of QueryDSL.

**Bugfixes**
* Fixed #110, paths with multiple ids (v1.0/Things(1)/Datastreams(2)/...) not
  always properly validated.
* Fixed #118, durations with year, month or week values were not parsed correctly.
* Fixed comparing JSON properties with each other in filters
* Fixed #116, filtering on Datastream/(phenomenon|result)Time returns Datastreams
  that have no such Time.


## Release Version 1.9

**New Features**
* Added experimental DELETE on Collections, with filters. Allows easier data cleanup.
  See <https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings/issues/44>
* Added experimental way to change the location of a Thing, without generating a
  HistoricalLocation with a time of now(). See #66 and <https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings/issues/30>.
* Added authentication support with two backends:
  * Basic: Using an internal user database and Basic authentication for HTTP.
  * Keycloak: Authenticating against an external Keycloak server.
* Added support for JSON-Patch [RFC6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) updates.
  This allows users to specify specific changes to be made to the properties object,
  without replacing the entire object.


## Release Version 1.8

**New Features**
* Upgraded moquette to v0.11.
* Allow setting of the moquette persistent store path and storage class.
* Enabling the tomcat CorsFilter to allow cross-site-scripting can be done from environment variables.
* Added option to automatically run the liquibase database upgrade.

**Bugfixes**
* Fixed #59, incorrect nextLink when filtering on unitOfMeasurement/name.
* Fixed `MultiDatastream.observationType` being required even though we set it automatically.
* Prioritise `persistence_db_url` over `persistence_db_jndi_datasource`. This way
  there is no longer the need to add an empty environment variable `persistence_db_jndi_datasource`
  for the HTTP and MQTTP component when configuring using environment variables.
* Fixed string ids in next- and selfLink not being urlEncoded.


## Release Version 1.7

**New Features**
* Observation.result can be explicitly set to null. This is useful in cases where
  an observation did not produce a value, but the fact that an observation was attempted
  must still be recorded.
* Exposed database connection options `persistence.db.conn.max`, `persistence.db.conn.idle.max`,
  `persistence.db.conn.idle.min`

**Bugfixes**
* Fixed #53: Query parser not Unicode aware.
* Fixed #52: Generating FeatureOfInterest did not work for Things with multiple
  Location entities when some of these entities were not geoJSON.
* Fixed the 'year' function not working on interval properties.


## Release Version 1.6

**New Features**
* User-defined-ids. FROST-Server can not be configured to allow the user to specify
  the id of created enitites.
  The new setting `persistence.idGenerationMode` has three allowed values:
  * `ServerGeneratedOnly`: No client defined ids allowed, database generates ids.
  * `ServerAndClientGenerated`: Both, server and client generated ids, are allowed.
  * `ClientGeneratedOnly`: Client has to provide @iot.id to create entities.

  Thanks to Marcel KÃ¶pke for the patch.

* Improved time handling in queries. FROST-Server can now calculate with times:

    ```/Observations?$filter=phenomenonTime gt now() sub duration'P1D' mul Datastream/properties/days```

* Separated the MQTT and HTTP parts of the server.
  The MQTT and HTTP parts of the server are now separated in to stand-alone programs:
  * FROST-Server.HTTP: contains a web-app handling the HTTP part of the server.
  * FROST-Server.MQTT: contains a java application handling the MQTT part of the server.
  * FROST-Server.MQTTP: contains a web-app combining HTTP and MQTT, like it was before.

  There can be multiple MQTT and HTTP instances using the same database, to allow for horizontal
  scaling on a cloud infrastructure. The instances communicate over a pluggable message bus.

* There are now three docker images:
  * The stand-alone HTTP package: fraunhoferiosb/frost-server-http.
  * The stand-alone MQTT package: fraunhoferiosb/frost-server-mqtt.
  * The all-in-one package: fraunhoferiosb/frost-server.

  An example configuration for docker-compose can be found as docker-compose-separated.yaml,
  that shows how the HTTP and MQTT packages can be started separately, with an MQTT message bus
  for communication between the HTTP and MQTT instances.

* All configuration parameters can now be overridden using environment variables.

**Bugfixes**
* Fixed service prefix in default config file.
* Fixed Tomcat breaking selfLinks for ids that are URLs.
* Fixed $select not working for @iot.id, in MQTT.
* Fixed #48: creation in Observations in MultiDatastreams using DataArray formatting fails.


## Release Version 1.5

**New Features**
* We have a name: FROST-Server
* Implemented the Batch-processing extension.

**Bugfixes**

* Available through dockerhub: `docker pull fraunhoferiosb/sensorthingsserver`

**Bugfixes**
* Fixed deep insert of MultiDatastreams.
* Fixed building with Java 9.
* Fixed EntityType initialisation sometimes failing.


## Release Version 1.3

**New Features**
* Added new backends, using PostgreSQL with String and UUID columns for entity ids.

**New Features**
* Added support for ISO8601 Interval formats in the form of \[instant]/\[duration]
  and \[duration]/\[instant]. For example: 2015-10-14T01:01:01.000+02:00/P1D.
* Added a json properties field to (Multi)Datastream, FoI, Location, ObservedProperty and Sensor.
* Added setting to limit data site of responses. In case of Observations with
  large results, or Things with large properties, this will reduce the $top when
  the max size is reached.

**Bugfixes**
* Fixed only application/vnd.geo+json being recognised as GeoJSON, but not application/geo+json.
* Fixed GIS-filters on FeatureOfInterest/feature not working.


## Release Version 1.1
