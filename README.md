A Server implementation of the [OGC SensorThings API](https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings). The **FR**aunhofer **O**pensource **S**ensor**T**hings-Server
is the first complete, open-source official reference implementation of the [OGC SensorThings API Part 1: Sensing 1.0](https://docs.ogc.org/is/15-078r6/15-078r6.html). It also implements [OGC SensorThings API Part 1: Sensing 1.1](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-088/18-088.html) and [OGC SensorThings API Part 2: Tasking Core 1.1](https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-079r1/17-079r1.html).


## Downloading

Instead of compiling the server yourself, you can also download pre-built war and jar files from Maven Central:
* [FROST-Server.MQTTP](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/fraunhofer/iosb/ilt/FROST-Server/FROST-Server.MQTTP/) FROST-Server.MQTTP-x.y.z.war
* [FROST-Server.HTTP](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/fraunhofer/iosb/ilt/FROST-Server/FROST-Server.HTTP/) FROST-Server.HTTP-x.y.z.war
* [FROST-Server.MQTT](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/fraunhofer/iosb/ilt/FROST-Server/FROST-Server.MQTT/) FROST-Server.MQTT-x.y.z-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Or you can [use Docker](https://fraunhoferiosb.github.io/FROST-Server/deployment/docker.html).


## Extendable Data Model and pluggable APIs

FROST-Server implements the SensorThings API data model and API, but is not limited to these.
Using plugins the data model can be extended or even completely replaced depending on your specific requirements.
APIs and result formats can also be added using plugins.
By default, FROST-Server comes with experimental plugins for the OData 4.0 and 4.01 APIs and for CSV and GeoJSON result formats.


## Fine-grained Authorisation

Authorisation rules can either be simple with Read, Create, Update and Delete on a service level,
or they can be very fine-grained with, for instance, certain users being able to read or create only Observations in Datastreams of certain Things.


## Documentation

Documentation can be found on the [documentation site](https://fraunhoferiosb.github.io/FROST-Server/)


## Changes and Updates

See the [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md).


## Kubernetes (Helm) support

See [helm/frost-server/README.md](helm/frost-server/README.md) for how to use the FROST-Server Helm chart for a Kubernetes deployment.


## Compiling

To compile FROST-Server you need to have a JDK and Maven installed.

1. Checkout the project from github: `git clone https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/FROST-Server.git`
2. Go to the project root (The top-most directory with a pom.xml) `cd FROST-Server`
3. Give the command `mvn clean install`. This should build the war and jar files in:
   * `FROST-Server.MQTTP/target/`
   * `FROST-Server.HTTP/target/`
   * `FROST-Server.MQTT/target/`
